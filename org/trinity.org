"The claim that the Spirit is not divine is usually followed by the equally false claim that the Spirit is merely a power God uses. This claim is highly problematic because it implies that God is not omnipotent in that he needs a power outside himself to accomplish his work and will."

The word for “spirit” (rucha, ruach) in Aramaic and Hebrew, is feminine whereas in Greek (pneuma), it is neuter in gender. In some occasions in the Greek text, masculine verb endings and pronouns are used with the neuter gender word “Spirit" when speaking about the holy Spirit, and sometimes it is without the definite article - i.e. just “holy Spirit”.  

the word 'Ruach' can be construed as a person. It is a person. She is invisible and like wind, because She can be felt or experienced, but not seen. She is the breath of God which disperses His life-force, His energy and His intentions/mind. She is Yahweh's Spirit which is omnipresent, but also can be directed in specific ways for specific purposes. She is not The Father (First Person of the Trinity), or The Son (Third Person of the Trinity) (which remain incorporeal in a sense and outside of our physical dimension) that manifests itself in the world, or which comes to dwell in the hearts and lives of His people; rather She is the Holy Spirit, the Second Person of the Triune God. She is God's Spirit, His heart.

The term in the Hebrew that is translated as 'Holy Spirit' is 'Ha Ruach Ha Kodesh.' There is a specific intention in the terminology “Holy Spirit” as compared to the reference to His Spirit without the definition of “holy”. The Spirit or ‘ruach’ by itself, is the breath of Yahweh which carries His life-force, but not necessarily the Presence of His Person.

The spirit is never worshiped, which could explain the lack of a physical form

Very significant also that the Holy Spirit is never worshipped. “And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.” Revelation 5:13
