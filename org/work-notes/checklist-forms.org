start with Bookstore Authorization, should be easy
non-filter is the most complex

make the form read only if staff
check permission list service for this, put in the endpoint (maybe)

WEBLIB_HI_USER GetEndPoints
check for save endpoints to see if its readonly

once a form is submitted it gets marked with item status (when submitted change to recieved / make it readonly)
WEBLIB_HCF_FORM xxx <- service will say if form is submittable
