# Why I use linux for indie game dev

## Pros
1. Commandline / Cmd tools

    Glue language - Text based tools - Incredibly easy to manage process
    Scripts to make backups, stream file from a server, monitor process
    Pull random wallpapers from the web and change the colorscheme based on that image

    A friend and I wanted to listen to this hard drive of mp3s together, so we created a streaming service using a
    bunch of random tools and glued it all together with a few bash scripts

2. Package management
3. Freedom and simplicity
4. Mold it to my work flow
5. Web dev
6. Snappy computer

## Cons
1. Tinkering and having too many choices
2. Debugging tools
3. Most of the benifits come from power users
4. Engines don't work or are a after thought
5. Gamers are on Windows

## Becoming popular
1. Game dev channels
2. Steam and Proton and Wine
